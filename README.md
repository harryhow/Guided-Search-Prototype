### Description
This prototype showcases few outcomes and bring some thoughts,

There are two broad concepts and ideas under the hood,
1. Visualize different types of 'V Neck', for example: deep v neck, vintage v neck, etc. 
From my personal experience, I can't really tell what's difference among those v necks but in different styles.

2. After selecting one specific style, user can then drag one of the v neck type with matching rainbow colors on the screen. (In this prototype, I only demo the color matching concept, the matching color function is faked for now) 

The idea is this color-matching behavior do not necessary stand for selecting apparel's color only but could be everything out of user's mind but in colors. For example, the color of party theme tonight? your current feeling, mood? the sky of your next trip? etc. I'm trying tohe imagine there's an AI engine behind this search, the process of selecting colors can be related to different scenarios of selecting apparels but not only limited to only apparelâ€™s color. 

### The protytpe
This prototype tries to blend a specific search (style) with heuristic search (colors).

1. A Coffee script code based, live-demo prototype made by Framer and Sketch 
2. Use Framer animation library to guide the user through the interface. 
3. No offline data. Borrow images assets from Zalando, Urban Outfitters' website. Use web font from Google. 
4. Imagine how the experience might be before or after these two steps?
