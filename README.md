### Description
This prototype showcases few outcomes and bring some thoughts,

This prototype is under two broad concepts and ideas,
1. Visualize different types of 'V Neck', for example: deep v neck, vintage v neck, etc. 
From my personal experience, I can't really tell what's difference among those v necks but in different styles.

2. After selecting one specific style, user can then drag one of the v neck type with matching colors on the screen. (In this prototype, I only demo the matching color concept, the matching color function is faked) The idea is this colors do not necessary stand for apparel's color but could be everything in colors. For example, your mood, your current feeling, etc. 

This approach trys to blend a specic search (style) with wildcard search (colors)

1. A Coffee script code based, live-demo prototype made by Framer and Sketch 
2. Use Framer animation library to guide the user through the interface. 
3. No offline data. Borrow images assets from Zalando, Urban Outfitters' website. Use webfont from Google. 
4. Imagine how the experience might be before or after these two steps?
